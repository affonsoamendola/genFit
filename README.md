# genFit

Little FORTRAN 90 program I wrote for fitting functions to a table of values using a randomized generational genetic algorithm for the Experimental Physics V Course at the Physics Institute of the University Of São Paulo, on 2018.

It kind of works, I still need to create a real user interface for it, maybe some day I'll get around to it.

You need to mess around with the constant values I define on the beginning of the program if you want to make it work, I managed to get better precision than the software we currently use for this purpose (http://webroot.if.usp.br/), but only after messing around A LOT with the constants.
